- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Damien! Welcome to my git dashboard! I'm currently a 3rd year undergraduate Statistics + Data Science student at the University of British Columbia. I'm interested in creating and learning about elegant visualizations and story-led analytics in data science.

- Here you can find all my public projects that I've been working on since 2019! Feel free to check them out and ask me anything about them!
- I'm currently looking for an internship/co-op position for Jan-Sep 2023. If my profile interests you, you can reach me at fungd2@student.ubc.ca
